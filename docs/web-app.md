# Web App

*Please note that this section is still under construction and may be
incomplete.*

The Typst web app is a collaborative environment made to work on Typst projects.
It features an editor with live-preview and real-time synchronization with your
co-authors. You can upload images and other files to load and display them in
your document.

It also offers various settings to work with others, from sharing a specific
project using a link, to creating a team to collaborate on a set of related
projects. You can refer to our documentation on [user accounts, projects and
teams](/docs/web-app/concepts) for more details about what the Typst web app is capable of and
how you can use it to best match your workflow.

Many features of the web app are free, only an account is required. Certain more
advanced features can be unlocked with a [Typst Pro subscription](https://typst.app/pricing). It's
also possible to get a license to host the web app [on-premises](https://typst.app/pricing) using
your company's infrastructure.
