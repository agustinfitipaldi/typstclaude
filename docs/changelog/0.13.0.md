# Version 0.13.0 (February 19, 2025)

## Highlights

- There is now a distinction between [proper paragraphs](/docs/reference/model/par/) and just
  inline-level content. This is important for future work on accessibility and
  means that [first line indent](/docs/reference/model/par/#parameters-first-line-indent) can now be enabled for
  all paragraphs instead of just consecutive ones.
- The [`outline`](/docs/reference/model/outline/ "`outline`") has a better out-of-the-box look and is more customizable
- The new [`curve`](/docs/reference/visualize/curve/ "`curve`") function (that supersedes the `path` function) provides a
  simpler and more flexible interface for creating Bézier curves
- The `image` function now supports raw [pixel raster formats](/docs/reference/visualize/image/#parameters-format)
  for generating images from within Typst
- Functions that accept [file paths](/docs/reference/syntax/#paths) now also accept raw
  [bytes](/docs/reference/foundations/bytes/ "bytes"), for full flexibility
- WebAssembly [plugins](/docs/reference/foundations/plugin/) are more flexible and automatically run
  multi-threaded
- Fixed a long-standing bug where single-letter strings in math (`$"a"$`)
  would be displayed in italics
- You can now specify which charset should be [covered](/docs/reference/text/text/#parameters-font) by which
  font family
- The [`pdf.embed`](/docs/reference/pdf/attach/) function lets you embed arbitrary files in the
  exported PDF
- HTML export is currently under active development. The feature is still *very*
  incomplete, but already available for experimentation behind a feature flag.

## Model

- There is now a distinction between [proper paragraphs](/docs/reference/model/par/) and just
  inline-level content **(Breaking change)**
  - All text at the root of a document is wrapped in paragraphs. Meanwhile, text
    in a container (like a block) is only wrapped in a paragraph if the
    container holds any block-level content. If all of the content is
    inline-level, no paragraph is created.
  - In the laid-out document, it's not immediately visible whether text became
    part of a paragraph. However, it is still important for accessibility, HTML
    export, and for properties like `first-line-indent`.
  - Show rules on `par` now only affect proper paragraphs
  - The `first-line-indent` and `hanging-indent` properties also only affect
    proper paragraphs
  - Creating a `par[..]` with body content that is not fully inline-level will
    result in a warning
  - The default show rules of various built-in elements like lists, quotes, etc.
    were adjusted to ensure they produce/don't produce paragraphs as appropriate
  - Removed support for booleans and content in [`outline.indent`](/docs/reference/model/outline/#parameters-indent "`outline.indent`")
- The [`outline`](/docs/reference/model/outline/ "`outline`") function was fully reworked to improve its out-of-the-box
  behavior **(Breaking change)**
  - [Outline entries](/docs/reference/model/outline/#definitions-entry) are now [blocks](/docs/reference/layout/block/) and are thus
    affected by block spacing
  - The `auto` indentation mode now aligns numberings and titles outline-wide
    for a grid-like look
  - Automatic indentation now also indents entries without a numbering
  - Titles wrapping over multiple lines now have hanging indent
  - The page number won't appear alone on its own line anymore
  - The link now spans the full entry instead of just the title and page number
  - The default spacing between outline leader dots was increased
  - The [`fill`](/docs/reference/model/outline/#definitions-entry-fill) parameter was moved from `outline` to
    `outline.entry` and can thus be configured through show-set rules
  - Removed `body` and `page` fields from outline entry
  - Added `indented`, `prefix`, `inner`, `body`, and `page` methods on outline
    entries to simplify writing of show rules
- Added configuration to [`par.first-line-indent`](/docs/reference/model/par/#parameters-first-line-indent "`par.first-line-indent`") for indenting all paragraphs
  instead of just consecutive ones
- Added [`form`](/docs/reference/model/ref/#parameters-form) parameter to `ref` function. Setting the form to
  `"page"` will produce a page reference instead of a textual one.
- Added [`document.description`](/docs/reference/model/document/#parameters-description "`document.description`") field, which results in corresponding PDF and
  HTML metadata
- Added [`enum.reversed`](/docs/reference/model/enum/#parameters-reversed "`enum.reversed`") parameter
- Added support for Greek [numbering](/docs/reference/model/numbering/ "numbering")
- When the [`link`](/docs/reference/model/link/ "`link`") function wraps around a container like a [block](/docs/reference/layout/block/ "block"), it will
  now generate only one link for the whole block instead of individual links for
  all the visible leaf elements. This significantly reduces PDF file sizes when
  combining `link` and [`repeat`](/docs/reference/layout/repeat/ "`repeat`").
- The [`link`](/docs/reference/model/link/ "`link`") function will now only strip one prefix (like `mailto:` or
  `tel:`) instead of multiple
- The link function now suppresses hyphenation via a built-in show-set rule
  rather than through its default show rule
- Displaying the page counter without a specified numbering will now take the
  page numbering into account

## Visualization

- Added new [`curve`](/docs/reference/visualize/curve/ "`curve`") function that supersedes the [`path`](/docs/reference/visualize/path/ "`path`") function and
  provides a simpler and more flexible interface. The `path` function is now
  deprecated.
- The `image` function now supports raw [pixel raster formats](/docs/reference/visualize/image/#parameters-format).
  This can be used to generate images from within Typst without the need for
  encoding in an image exchange format.
- Added [`image.scaling`](/docs/reference/visualize/image/#parameters-scaling "`image.scaling`") parameter for configuring how an image is scaled by
  PNG export and PDF viewers (smooth or pixelated)
- Added [`image.icc`](/docs/reference/visualize/image/#parameters-icc "`image.icc`") parameter for providing or overriding the ICC profile of
  an image
- Renamed `pattern` to [`tiling`](/docs/reference/visualize/tiling/ "`tiling`"). The name `pattern` remains as a deprecated
  alias.
- Added [`gradient.center`](/docs/reference/visualize/gradient/#definitions-center "`gradient.center`"), [`gradient.radius`](/docs/reference/visualize/gradient/#definitions-radius "`gradient.radius`"), [`gradient.focal-center`](/docs/reference/visualize/gradient/#definitions-focal-center "`gradient.focal-center`"), and
  [`gradient.focal-radius`](/docs/reference/visualize/gradient/#definitions-focal-radius "`gradient.focal-radius`") methods
- Fixed interaction of clipping and outset on [`box`](/docs/reference/layout/box/ "`box`") and [`block`](/docs/reference/layout/block/ "`block`")
- Fixed panic with [`path`](/docs/reference/visualize/path/ "`path`") of infinite length
- Fixed non-solid (e.g. tiling) text fills in clipped blocks
- Fixed a crash for images with a DPI value of zero
- Fixed floating-point error in [`gradient.repeat`](/docs/reference/visualize/gradient/#definitions-repeat "`gradient.repeat`")
- Auto-detection of image formats from a raw buffer now has support for SVGs

## Scripting

- Functions that accept [file paths](/docs/reference/syntax/#paths) now also accept raw
  [bytes](/docs/reference/foundations/bytes/ "bytes")
  - [`image`](/docs/reference/visualize/image/ "`image`"), [`cbor`](/docs/reference/data-loading/cbor/ "`cbor`"), [`csv`](/docs/reference/data-loading/csv/ "`csv`"), [`json`](/docs/reference/data-loading/json/ "`json`"), [`toml`](/docs/reference/data-loading/toml/ "`toml`"), [`xml`](/docs/reference/data-loading/xml/ "`xml`"), and [`yaml`](/docs/reference/data-loading/yaml/ "`yaml`") now
    support a path string or bytes and their `.decode` variants are deprecated
  - [`plugin`](/docs/reference/foundations/plugin/ "`plugin`"), [`bibliography`](/docs/reference/model/bibliography/ "`bibliography`"), [`bibliography.style`](/docs/reference/model/bibliography/#parameters-style "`bibliography.style`"), [`cite.style`](/docs/reference/model/cite/#parameters-style "`cite.style`"),
    [`raw.theme`](/docs/reference/text/raw/#parameters-theme "`raw.theme`"), and [`raw.syntaxes`](/docs/reference/text/raw/#parameters-syntaxes "`raw.syntaxes`") now accept bytes in addition to path
    strings. These did not have `.decode` variants, so this adds new
    flexibility.
  - The `path` argument/field of [`image`](/docs/reference/visualize/image/ "`image`") and [`bibliography`](/docs/reference/model/bibliography/ "`bibliography`") was renamed to
    `source` and `sources`, respectively **(Minor breaking change)**
- Improved WebAssembly [plugins](/docs/reference/foundations/plugin/)
  - The `plugin` type is replaced by a [`plugin` function](/docs/reference/foundations/plugin/) that returns
    a [module](/docs/reference/foundations/module/ "module") containing normal Typst functions. This module can be used with
    import syntax. **(Breaking change)**
  - Plugins now automatically run in multiple threads without any changes by
    plugin authors
  - A new [`plugin.transition`](/docs/reference/foundations/plugin/#definitions-transition "`plugin.transition`") API is introduced which allows plugins to run
    impure initialization in a way that doesn't break Typst's purity guarantees
- The variable name bound by a bare import (no renaming, no import list) is now
  determined statically and dynamic imports without `as` renaming (e.g.
  `import "ot" + "her.typ"`) are a hard error **(Breaking change)**
- Values of the [`arguments`](/docs/reference/foundations/arguments/ "`arguments`") type can now be added with `+` and
  [joined](/docs/reference/scripting/#blocks) in curly-braced code blocks
- Functions in an element function's scope can now be called with method syntax,
  bringing elements and types closer (in anticipation of a future full
  unification of the two). Currently, this is only useful for [`outline.entry`](/docs/reference/model/outline/#definitions-entry "`outline.entry`")
  as no other element function defines methods.
- Added [`calc.norm`](/docs/reference/foundations/calc/#functions-norm "`calc.norm`") function
- Added support for 32-bit floats in [`float.from-bytes`](/docs/reference/foundations/float/#definitions-from-bytes "`float.from-bytes`") and [`float.to-bytes`](/docs/reference/foundations/float/#definitions-to-bytes "`float.to-bytes`")
- The [`decimal`](/docs/reference/foundations/decimal/ "`decimal`") constructor now also accepts decimal values
- Improved `repr` of [symbols](/docs/reference/foundations/symbol/), [arguments](/docs/reference/foundations/arguments/ "arguments"), and [types](/docs/reference/foundations/type/)
- Duplicate [symbol](/docs/reference/foundations/symbol/ "symbol") variants and modifiers are now a hard error
  **(Breaking change)**

  in italics
- Math function calls can now have hyphenated named arguments and support
  [argument spreading](/docs/reference/foundations/arguments/#spreading)

  Forms) and `dtls` (Dotless Forms) OpenType features
- Added `lcm` [text operator](/docs/reference/math/op/)
- The [`bold`](/docs/reference/math/styles/#functions-bold) function now works with ϝ and Ϝ
- The [`italic`](/docs/reference/math/styles/#functions-italic) function now works with ħ
- Fixed a bug where the extent of a math equation was wrongly affected by
  internal metadata
- Fixed interaction of [`lr`](/docs/reference/math/lr/#functions-lr) and [context](/docs/reference/context/ "context") expressions
- Fixed weak spacing being unconditionally ignored in [`lr`](/docs/reference/math/lr/#functions-lr)
- Fixed sub/superscripts sometimes being in the wrong position with
  [`lr`](/docs/reference/math/lr/#functions-lr)
- Fixed multi-line annotations (e.g. overbrace) changing the math baseline
- Fixed merging of attachments when the base is a nested equation
- Fixed resolving of contextual (em-based) text sizes within math
- Fixed spacing around up tacks (⊥)

## Bibliography

- Prose and author-only citations now use editor names if the author names are
  unavailable
- Some non-standard but widely used BibLaTeX `editortype`s like `producer`,
  `writer`, `scriptwriter`, and `none` (defined by widespread style
  `biblatex-chicago` to mean performers within `music` and `video` entries) are
  now recognized
- CSL styles can now render affixes around the bibliography
- For BibTeX entries with `eprinttype = {pubmed}`, the PubMed ID will now be
  correctly processed
- Whitespace handling for strings delimiting initialized names has been improved

  Arabic

## Text

- Added support for specifying which charset should be [covered](/docs/reference/text/text/#parameters-font) by
  which font family
- Added [`all`](/docs/reference/text/smallcaps/#parameters-all) parameter to `smallcaps` function that also
  enables small capitals on uppercase letters
- Added basic i18n for Basque and Bulgarian

## Syntax

- Top-level closing square brackets that do not have a matching opening square
  bracket are now a hard error **(Minor breaking change)**
- Adding a space between the identifier and the parentheses in a set rule is not
  allowed anymore **(Minor breaking change)**
- Numbers with a unit cannot have a base prefix anymore, e.g. `0b100000pt` is
  not allowed anymore. Previously, it was syntactically allowed but always
  resolved to a value of zero. **(Minor breaking change)**

  exported PDF
- Added support for PDF/A-3b export
- The PDF timestamp will now contain the timezone by default

## HTML export

**Note:** HTML export is currently under active development. The feature is
still *very* incomplete, but already available for experimentation behind a
feature flag.

  into HTML (by embedding an SVG)
- Added [`target`](/docs/reference/foundations/target/ "`target`") function which returns either `"paged"` or `"html"`
  depending on the export target

## Tooling and Diagnostics

- Autocompletion improvements
  - Added autocompletion for file paths

    only show variables which contain a valid fill (either directly or nested,
    e.g. a dictionary containing a valid fill)
