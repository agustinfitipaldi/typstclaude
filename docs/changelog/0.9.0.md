# Version 0.9.0 (October 31, 2023)

## Bibliography management

- New bibliography engine based on [CSL](https://citationstyles.org/) (Citation
  Style Language). Ships with about 100 commonly used citation styles and can
  load custom `.csl` files.
- Added new [`form`](/docs/reference/model/cite/#parameters-form) argument to the `cite` function to produce
  different forms of citations (e.g. for producing a citation suitable for
  inclusion in prose)
- The [`cite`](/docs/reference/model/cite/ "`cite`") function now takes only a single label/key instead of allowing
  multiple. Adjacent citations are merged and formatted according to the
  citation style's rules automatically. This works both with the reference
  syntax and explicit calls to the `cite` function. **(Breaking change)**
- The `cite` function now takes a [label](/docs/reference/foundations/label/ "label") instead of a string
  **(Breaking change)**
- Added [`full`](/docs/reference/model/bibliography/#parameters-full) argument to bibliography function to print
  the full bibliography even if not all works were cited
- Bibliography entries can now contain Typst equations (wrapped in `$..$` just
  like in markup), this works both for `.yaml` and `.bib` bibliographies
- The hayagriva YAML format was improved. See its
  [changelog](https://github.com/typst/hayagriva/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) for
  more details. **(Breaking change)**
- A few bugs with `.bib` file parsing were fixed
- Removed `brackets` argument of `cite` function in favor of `form`

  - Added support for [gradients](/docs/reference/visualize/gradient/) on shapes and text
  - Supports linear, radial, and conic gradients
  - Added support for defining colors in more color spaces, including
    [Oklab](/docs/reference/visualize/color/#definitions-oklab), [Linear RGB(A)](/docs/reference/visualize/color/#definitions-linear-rgb),
    [HSL](/docs/reference/visualize/color/#definitions-hsl), and [HSV](/docs/reference/visualize/color/#definitions-hsv)
  - Added [`saturate`](/docs/reference/visualize/color/#definitions-saturate), [`desaturate`](/docs/reference/visualize/color/#definitions-desaturate), and
    [`rotate`](/docs/reference/visualize/color/#definitions-rotate) functions on colors
  - Added [`color.map`](/docs/reference/visualize/color/#predefined-color-maps) module with predefined
    color maps that can be used with gradients
  - Rename `kind` function on colors to [`space`](/docs/reference/visualize/color/#definitions-space)
  - Removed `to-rgba`, `to-cmyk`, and `to-luma` functions in favor of a new
    [`components`](/docs/reference/visualize/color/#definitions-components) function
- Improved rendering of [rectangles](/docs/reference/visualize/rect/) with corner radius and varying
  stroke widths
- Added support for properly clipping [boxes](/docs/reference/layout/box/#parameters-clip) and
  [blocks](/docs/reference/layout/block/#parameters-clip) with a border radius

  individual lines of raw text, e.g. to add line numbers while keeping proper
  syntax highlighting
- Added support for per-side [inset](/docs/reference/model/table/#parameters-inset) customization to table
  function

  [`strike`](/docs/reference/text/strike/ "`strike`") functions
- Fixed crash for [floating placed elements](/docs/reference/layout/place/#parameters-float) with no specified
  vertical alignment
- Partially fixed a bug with citations in footnotes

## Math

  [`cases`](/docs/reference/math/cases/#parameters-gap) function
- Added `size` argument for [`abs`](/docs/reference/math/lr/#functions-abs), [`norm`](/docs/reference/math/lr/#functions-norm),

## Performance

- Fixed a bug related to show rules in templates which would effectively disable
  incremental compilation in affected documents
- Micro-optimized code in several hot paths, which brings substantial
  performance gains, in particular in incremental compilations
- Improved incremental parsing, which affects the whole incremental compilation
  pipeline
- Added support for incremental parsing in the CLI
- Added support for incremental SVG encoding during PDF export, which greatly
  improves export performance for documents with many SVG

## Tooling and Diagnostics

- Improved autocompletion for variables that are in-scope
- Added autocompletion for package imports
- Added autocompletion for [labels](/docs/reference/foundations/label/)
- Added tooltip that shows which variables a function captures (when hovering
  over the equals sign or arrow of the function)
- Diagnostics are now deduplicated
- Improved diagnostics when trying to apply unary `+` or `-` to types that only
  support binary `+` and `-`
- Error messages now state which label or citation key isn't present in the
  document or its bibliography
- Fixed a bug where function argument parsing errors were shadowed by function
  execution errors (e.g. when trying to call [`array.sorted`](/docs/reference/foundations/array/#definitions-sorted) and
  passing the key function as a positional argument instead of a named one).

## Export

- Added support for configuring the document's creation
  [`date`](/docs/reference/model/document/#parameters-date). If the `date` is set to `auto` (the default), the
  PDF's creation date will be set to the current date and time.
- Added support for configuring document [`keywords`](/docs/reference/model/document/#parameters-keywords)
- Generated PDFs now contain PDF document IDs
- The PDF creator tool metadata now includes the Typst version

## Web app

- Added version picker to pin a project to an older compiler version
  (with support for Typst 0.6.0+)
- Fixed desyncs between editor and compiler and improved overall stability
- The app now continues to highlight the document when typing while the document
  is being compiled

## Command line interface

- Added support for discovering fonts through fontconfig
- Now clears the screen instead of resetting the terminal
- Now automatically picks correct file extension for selected output format
- Now only regenerates images for changed pages when using `typst watch` with
  PNG or SVG export

## Miscellaneous Improvements

- Added [`version`](/docs/reference/foundations/version/ "`version`") type and `sys.version` constant specifying the current
  compiler version. Can be used to gracefully support multiple versions.
- The U+2212 MINUS SIGN is now used when displaying a numeric value, in the
  [`repr`](/docs/reference/foundations/repr/ "`repr`") of any numeric value and to replace a normal hyphen in text mode when
  before a digit. This improves, in particular, how negative integer values are
  displayed in math mode.
- Added support for specifying a default value instead of failing for `remove`
  function in [array](/docs/reference/foundations/array/#definitions-remove) and [dictionary](/docs/reference/foundations/dictionary/#definitions-remove)
- Simplified Page Setup Guide examples
- Switched the documentation from using the word "hashtag" to the word "hash"
  where appropriate
- Added support for [`array.zip`](/docs/reference/foundations/array/#definitions-zip) without any further arguments
- Fixed crash when a plugin tried to read out of bounds memory
- Fixed crashes when handling infinite [lengths](/docs/reference/layout/length/)
- Fixed introspection (mostly bibliography) bugs due to weak page break close to
  the end of the document

## Development

- Extracted `typst::ide` into separate `typst_ide` crate
- Removed a few remaining `'static` bounds on `&dyn World`
- Removed unnecessary dependency, which reduces the binary size
- Fixed compilation of `typst` by itself (without `typst-library`)
- Fixed warnings with Nix flake when using `lib.getExe`
