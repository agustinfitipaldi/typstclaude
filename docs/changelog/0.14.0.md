## PDF export

PDF export was fully rewritten to use the new [`krilla`](https://github.com/LaurenzV/krilla) library, fixing various bugs and enabling many improvements. Known fixes are listed below, but there will likely be other changes in how the output behaves. If you spot any regressions, please [report them on GitHub](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues). *(Thanks to [@LaurenzV](https://github.com/LaurenzV) for creating krilla!)* [#5420](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/5420 "#5420")

- Typst now produces *accessible* PDFs out of the box. Such documents are suitable for consumption in a wide range of circumstances. That not only includes consumption by people with permanent or temporary disabilities, but also by those with different devices or preferences.
  - Typst PDFs are now *tagged* by default. *Tags* are rich metadata that PDF viewers can use to make the document consumable in other ways than visually (e.g., through a screen reader).
  - In addition, Typst can now emit documents conforming to the PDF/UA-1 standard. (PDF/UA-2 is not yet supported, but planned.)
  - There is an increasing amount of existing and upcoming legislation requiring documents to be accessible, for instance, the European Accessibility Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act.
  - For more details on all of this, read the new [Accessibility Guide](/docs/guides/accessibility/).
- Typst now supports all PDF/A standards: PDF/A-1b, PDF/A-1a, PDF/A-2b, PDF/A-2u, PDF/A-2a, PDF/A-3b, PDF/A-3u, PDF/A-3a, PDF/A-4, PDF/A-4f, and PDF/A-4e. See the [expanded PDF/A documentation](/docs/reference/pdf/#pdf-a) for guidance on how to select a suitable standard. [#5420](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/5420 "#5420") [#7038](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/7038 "#7038")
- Typst now supports the PDF versions 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, and 2.0 in addition to PDF 1.7. See the [relevant section of the PDF documentation](/docs/reference/pdf/#pdf-versions) for details. [#5420](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/5420 "#5420")
- Added [`pdf.artifact`](/docs/reference/pdf/artifact/ "`pdf.artifact`") function for marking content as not semantically meaningful [#6619](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/6619 "#6619")
- Added experimental [`pdf.header-cell`](/docs/reference/pdf/header-cell/ "`pdf.header-cell`"), [`pdf.data-cell`](/docs/reference/pdf/data-cell/ "`pdf.data-cell`"), and [`pdf.table-summary`](/docs/reference/pdf/table-summary/ "`pdf.table-summary`") functions for enhancing accessibility of documents with complex tables. These functions are guarded by the `a11y-extras` feature. They do not have a final interface and will be removed in the future, either through integration into table functions or through full removal. [#6619](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/6619 "#6619")
- PDF heading bookmarks now contain the heading's numbering [#6622](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/6622 "#6622")
- [Attachments](/docs/reference/pdf/attach/)
  - Renamed `pdf.embed` to [`pdf.attach`](/docs/reference/pdf/attach/ "`pdf.attach`") (the old name will remain as a deprecated alias until Typst 0.15) [#6705](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/6705 "#6705")
  - The [`mime`](/docs/reference/pdf/attach/#parameters-mime-type) property of `pdf.attach` is now checked for syntactical correctness **(Minor breaking change)**
  - Fixed parsing of the [`data`](/docs/reference/pdf/attach/#parameters-data) argument of `pdf.attach` [#6435](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/6435 "#6435")
  - Attachments now smartly determine whether they should be compressed [#6256](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/6256 "#6256")
- Text extraction (i.e. copy paste)
  - Now works correctly even when multiple different characters result in the same glyph [#5420](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/5420 "#5420")
  - Spaces between words at which a natural line break occurred are now correctly retained for text extraction [#6866](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/6866 "#6866")
  - Fixed mapping of hyphenation artifacts to Unicode text [#6799](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/6799 "#6799")
- Images
  - CMYK images now work properly in PDF export [#5420](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/5420 "#5420")
  - Improved export of text in SVG images with a filter [#5420](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/5420 "#5420")

- Fixed gradients with transparency [#5420](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/5420 "#5420")

## HTML export

- Added support for many more built-in elements (the [*Model* category](/docs/reference/model/) is now fully covered)
  - The [`image`](/docs/reference/visualize/image/ "`image`") element [#6578](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/6578 "#6578")
  - The [`footnote`](/docs/reference/model/footnote/ "`footnote`") and [`footnote.entry`](/docs/reference/model/footnote/#definitions-entry "`footnote.entry`") element [#6917](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/6917 "#6917")

  - The [`underline`](/docs/reference/text/underline/ "`underline`"), [`overline`](/docs/reference/text/overline/ "`overline`"), [`strike`](/docs/reference/text/strike/ "`strike`"), and [`highlight`](/docs/reference/text/highlight/ "`highlight`") elements [#6510](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/6510 "#6510")
  - The [`smallcaps`](/docs/reference/text/smallcaps/ "`smallcaps`") element [#6600](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/6600 "#6600")
  - The [`lower`](/docs/reference/text/lower/ "`lower`") and [`upper`](/docs/reference/text/upper/ "`upper`") functions [#6585](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/6585 "#6585")
- Added typed HTML API (e.g. [`html.div`](/docs/reference/html/typed/#functions-div "`html.div`")) with individually typed attributes [#6476](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/6476 "#6476")
  - For example, to generate a `video` element you can now write `#html.video(width: 400, src: "sunrise.mp4")` instead of `#html.elem("video", attrs: (width: "400", src: "sunrise.mp4"))`. Note how the `width` attribute takes an integer instead of a string.

- Improved encoding of [`html.frame`](/docs/reference/html/frame/ "`html.frame`") [#6605](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/6605 "#6605")
- Empty attributes are now encoded with shorthand syntax (e.g. `<div hidden></div>`) [#6479](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/6479 "#6479")
- Zero-sized horizontal weak spacing (`h(0pt, weak: true)`) does not cause a "was ignored during HTML export" warning anymore, so it can be used to destruct surrounding spaces without producing any output, as in paged export [#6917](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/6917 "#6917")
- Fixed encoding of `<pre>` and `<textarea>` elements that start with a newline [#6487](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/6487 "#6487") [#6497](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/6497 "#6497")

## Layout

- Added opt-in support for character-level justification in addition to word-level justification, configured via the new [`par.justification-limits`](/docs/reference/model/par/#parameters-justification-limits "`par.justification-limits`") property. This is an impactful microtypographical technique that can significantly improve the appearance of justified text. [#6161](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/6161 "#6161")
- Fixed wrong linebreak opportunities related to object replacement characters [#6251](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/6251 "#6251")

- Code points that have a symbol and emoji presentation now have the correct variation selector attached depending on whether they appear in `sym` or `emoji`. That said, they still don't render consistently in Typst due to how font fallback works. [typst/codex#114](https://github.com/typst/codex/issues/114 "typst/codex#114")
- The [`symbol`](/docs/reference/foundations/symbol/ "`symbol`") function can now be used to create symbols that comprise not just one character, but one full grapheme cluster [#6489](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/6489 "#6489")

## Deprecations

## Removals

- Removed compatibility behavior of type/str comparisons (e.g. `int == "integer"`), which was temporarily introduced in Typst 0.8 and deprecated in Typst 0.13 **(Breaking change)**

## Development

- The `Default` impl for `Library` had to be removed for crate splitting and trait coherence reasons, but you can get a drop-in replacement via `use typst::LibraryExt` [#6576](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/6576 "#6576")
- The `PdfOptions` struct has a new `tagged` field, which defaults to `true` [#6619](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/6619 "#6619") [#7046](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/7046 "#7046")
- Fixed a potential panic in `World::font` implementations. Downstream `World` implementations might need to apply [the same fix](https://github.com/typst/typst/pull/6117). [#6117](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/6117 "#6117")
- Increased minimum supported Rust version to 1.88 [#6637](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/6637 "#6637")
