# Version 0.14.1 (December 3, 2025)

## PDF export

- Fixed regression where links to labelled elements would sometimes not work correctly [LaurenzV/krilla#304](https://github.com/LaurenzV/krilla/issues/304 "LaurenzV/krilla#304")
- Fixed bug where PDF text attributes could be written incorrectly [#7478](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/7478 "#7478")
- Fixed crash in link handling [#7471](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/7471 "#7471")
- Fixed crash for zero-sized pages [#7454](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/7454 "#7454")
- Fixed crash when a table [`vline`](/docs/reference/model/table/#definitions-vline) or [`hline`](/docs/reference/model/table/#definitions-hline) has an out-of-bounds index [#7448](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/7448 "#7448")
- Fixed crash in formatting of font-related PDF export errors [#7460](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/7460 "#7460")
- Fixed crash when a [`footnote`](/docs/reference/model/footnote/ "`footnote`") or [`place`](/docs/reference/layout/place/ "`place`") element was queried and reinserted into the document [#7216](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/7216 "#7216")
- Fixed crash for PNGs with invalid metadata [LaurenzV/krilla#286](https://github.com/LaurenzV/krilla/issues/286 "LaurenzV/krilla#286"), [LaurenzV/krilla#287](https://github.com/LaurenzV/krilla/issues/287 "LaurenzV/krilla#287")
- Fixed bug where text in SVGs with `fill-and-stroke` paint order could be exported incorrectly [LaurenzV/krilla#292](https://github.com/LaurenzV/krilla/issues/292 "LaurenzV/krilla#292")
- Fixed bug with layer isolation in SVGs where blending/masking is used [LaurenzV/krilla#295](https://github.com/LaurenzV/krilla/issues/295 "LaurenzV/krilla#295")
- Fixed that table headers could be tagged incorrectly in some scenarios [LaurenzV/krilla#289](https://github.com/LaurenzV/krilla/issues/289 "LaurenzV/krilla#289")
- Fixed issues where generated PDFs could differ between 32-bit and 64-bit systems [LaurenzV/krilla#317](https://github.com/LaurenzV/krilla/issues/317 "LaurenzV/krilla#317"), [LaurenzV/krilla#316](https://github.com/LaurenzV/krilla/issues/316 "LaurenzV/krilla#316"), [LaurenzV/krilla#312](https://github.com/LaurenzV/krilla/issues/312 "LaurenzV/krilla#312")
- Upgraded JPEG decoder used during PDF export for improved compatibility, fixing a case where a valid JPEG was rejected [LaurenzV/krilla#288](https://github.com/LaurenzV/krilla/issues/288 "LaurenzV/krilla#288")
- A PDF document information dictionary that would be empty is now fully omitted instead [LaurenzV/krilla#280](https://github.com/LaurenzV/krilla/issues/280 "LaurenzV/krilla#280")
- A rare crash in PDF tagging was turned into a compiler error [#7450](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/7450 "#7450")

## HTML export

- Fixed export of table [headers](/docs/reference/model/table/#definitions-header) and [footers](/docs/reference/model/table/#definitions-footer) with gutter [#7332](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/7332 "#7332")
- A [`page`](/docs/reference/layout/page/ "`page`") set rule in HTML export is now a warning instead of a hard error, in line with how unsupported elements are generally treated [#7513](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/7513 "#7513")

## Math

- Fixed regression where `arrow.l.r` could not be used as an [accent](/docs/reference/math/accent/) anymore [#7481](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/7481 "#7481")
- Fixed that single-letter strings did not react to spaces around them like multi-letter strings do [#7276](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/7276 "#7276")
- Fixed that spacing around [`mat`](/docs/reference/math/mat/) and [`vec`](/docs/reference/math/vec/) with a fence delimiter was whitespace-dependent [#7309](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/7309 "#7309")
- Fixed height calculation for horizontally stretched glyphs [#7327](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/7327 "#7327")

## Model

- Fixed regression where Typst would error in heading numbering functions that don't handle the counter state `(0,)`. This can occur in the first layout iteration. Such errors are usually automatically caught by Typst, which was not the case here. [#7459](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/7459 "#7459")

## Text

- Fixed regression where Typst would synthesize superscripts for some fonts even when [typographic](/docs/reference/text/super/#parameters-typographic) glyphs were available [#7462](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/7462 "#7462")
- Fixed regression where some oblique fonts would be classified as italic [#7483](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/7483 "#7483")

## Scripting

- Fixed crash due to violated invariants in [`array.sorted`](/docs/reference/foundations/array/#definitions-sorted "`array.sorted`") [#7520](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/7520 "#7520")
- Fixed crashes due to overflow in [`calc.rem`](/docs/reference/foundations/calc/#functions-rem "`calc.rem`"), [`calc.rem-euclid`](/docs/reference/foundations/calc/#functions-rem-euclid "`calc.rem-euclid`"), [`calc.div-euclid`](/docs/reference/foundations/calc/#functions-div-euclid "`calc.div-euclid`"), [`calc.quo`](/docs/reference/foundations/calc/#functions-quo "`calc.quo`"), and [`calc.gcd`](/docs/reference/foundations/calc/#functions-gcd "`calc.gcd`") [#7419](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/7419 "#7419")
- Upgraded WebAssembly runtime, fixing a bug that [plugins](/docs/reference/foundations/plugin/) could run into [#7438](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/7438 "#7438")

## Command Line Interface

- Compiling to standard output in combination with `--deps --deps-format=make` (which results in an error) will not produce an empty Make dependency file as a side effect anymore [#7246](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/7246 "#7246")

## Development

- Increased minimum supported Rust version to 1.89 [#7363](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/7363 "#7363")
