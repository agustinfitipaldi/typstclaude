# Invite by Email

To invite external collaborators to a project, you can use share links. If you
have a Typst Pro subscription, you can also use the "Invite by email" feature.
As its name suggests, it lets you enter an email address to invite someone to
collaborate on a project.

To invite someone using their email address, head to the "Share" modal using the
dedicated button above the preview of your project. The first section allows you
to manage share links, the email invitations are managed below.

Type the email, choose whether the person will have read, review or write
access, and click on the arrow button to send the invite. If you get the email
or access level wrong, you will have to cancel the invite and create a new one.

To delete a pending invite, you can use the member list below, which contains
both external collaborators who already joined the project and the ones who have
not yet accepted the invitation.

If you invite someone who doesn't yet have a Typst account, they will have the
opportunity to create one. Email invites don't allow for anonymous access, as
opposed to share links.
