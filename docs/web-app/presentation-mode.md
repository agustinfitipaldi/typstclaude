# Presentation Mode

Presentations are a great use case for Typst, be it with a hand-rolled template
or using a package like [polylux](https://typst.app/universe/package/polylux) or [touying](https://typst.app/universe/package/touying/). The strengths
of a markup- and automation-based approach come to light especially when you're
reusing content across a presentation and a report.

With Typst Pro's built-in presentation mode, you can give your next talk right
from the Typst app.

## Presenting

When Typst detects a 16-9 or 4-3 page aspect ratio, it will automatically
display the ![Present](/assets/icons/16-play.svg)
"Present" button next to the "Share" button. Alternative, you can start
presenting a document with any kind of aspect ratio via "View > Present" from
the menubar. To leave the presentation mode, click the large red ![Close](/assets/icons/16-close.svg) button or press
Escape.

By default, Typst will display the presentation on your current monitor in
full-screen mode. Alternatively, you can click the dropdown arrow next to the
"Present" button and select "Speaker Mode". Now, the presentation will open in a
separate window, which you can fullscreen on a display of your choice. The main
window will then display the Speaker Mode. To switch from Speaker Mode to in-tab
presentation, select "View > Show presentation in this window".

## Speaker Mode

The Speaker Mode is your control center during the presentation. On the left
side, it displays the current slide and at the bottom controls to navigate to
the previous and next slide, to highlight and draw on the slide, and to
temporarily hide the current slide. On the right side, it displays the upcoming
slide, the current time, and for how long you've been presenting. The green bar
at the bottom indicates how far you've progressed in your presentation.

## Moving through the slides

You can move to the next slide by clicking the left mouse button or pressing the
right arrow key. To move one slide back, click the right mouse button or press
the left arrow key.

## The timer

The right panel show the current time and a timer indicating how long you've
been presenting. If you've been preparing for a bit, with speaker mode already
open, you can click the ![Reset](/assets/icons/16-reset.svg) Reset button to
set the timer back to zero right before you start to present.

## Highlighting with the laser pointer

To highlight something on the slide, you can use the built-in laser pointer.
Select ![Pointer options](/assets/icons/16-pointer.svg)
"Pointer options" in the bottom left toolbar and then "Laser" or press L
to enable the laser pointer. To disable the laser pointer, select "None" from
said menu or press L again.

## Drawing on the slides

To draw on the slide, select ![Pointer options](/assets/icons/16-pointer.svg) "Pointer options" from the toolbar
and then "Pen" or press Shift+L. In the "Ink color" menu just below, you can
select from different colors for your drawing.

You can now start drawing on the slide. Your drawings remain in place as you
navigate to other slides, but are cleared once you leave presentation mode.

To clear drawings from the current or all slides, select the corresponding menu
entry from the "Pointer options" menu. Note that it's not currently possible to
erase drawings more selectively.

## Lights off

The ![Lightbulb](/assets/icons/16-assist.svg)
button in the bottom toolbar (or the B key) temporarily hides the
presentation from your audience. In the Speaker Mode, the slide contents appear
dimmed, but you can continue to navigate in your presentation, to find just the
right place for turning the lights back on.

## Speaker notes

Currently, Typst's presentation mode does not have a facility for speaker notes.
This is planned for the future.
