# none

A value that indicates the absence of any other value.

The none type has exactly one value: `none`.

When inserted into the document, it is not visible. This is also the value
that is produced by empty code blocks. It can be
[joined](/docs/reference/scripting/#blocks) with any value, yielding the other value.

## Example

```
Not visible: #none
```
